&lt;p&gt;Now, I still need to catch up with some of the session videos, but having seen most of the ones in my playlist, there are some considerations that I‚Äôm ready to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-i-got-my-predictions-right&quot;&gt;Did I got my predictions right?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed my previous &lt;a href=&quot;/2017-06-02-what-to-expect-wwdc-2017&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I tried with my guessing hat to come up with some predictions of what Apple have been preparing for us, and I‚Äôm glad they were spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;swift-refactoring-tools-on-xcode&quot;&gt;Swift refactoring tools on Xcode&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have Swift refactoring in Xcode 9. Available since the first beta, they even got improved with the second beta, either by fixing issues or by adding new refactorings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;real-multitasking-on-ipad&quot;&gt;Real multitasking on iPad&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the iPad received  most of the love. Not that the new multitasking features don‚Äôt work on the iPhone, they are of course far less usable (or not available at all) than on devices with bigger screens. It shows that Apple engineers invested a lot of time on this, not only for all the features but how easy it looks to use them in our apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predictions-from-other-people-obviously-much-clever-than-me&quot;&gt;Predictions from other people, obviously much clever than me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;siri-speaker&quot;&gt;Siri Speaker&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will only be available in six months time, so what was available were prototypes (probably very close to the final version). Even though, the general comments are that it is a pretty solid device, with excellent sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;new-ipad-pro-105-inch&quot;&gt;New iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had the chance to play with a 1st gen iPad Pro with a Pencil a couple of weeks ago, but boy, was that fun! The responsiveness of the Pencil together with all that screen estate, coupled with a few well implemented apps made me feel like I was an artist (which I‚Äôm obviously not). This new iPad Pro, which I had the opportunity to see live already, looks like a perfect combination of power with usability, and together with the new features from iOS 11, I bet it will bump the sales for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;new-layout-of-the-iphones-back-side&quot;&gt;New layout of the iPhones back side&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is still to be confirmed, and I haven‚Äôt seen or read anything that points to it being a thing, so it remains to be proved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;dark-mode&quot;&gt;Dark mode&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it‚Äôs not a full dark mode, it‚Äôs a feature called ‚ÄúSmart Invert Colors‚Äù and it looks like it‚Äôs applying a dark background instead of a white one, maintaining the remaining colors. Again, need to have a device with it to properly test it, but it looks like a good start to a full dark theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-stuff-i-didnt-remember-or-even-thought-it-would-be-possible-to-happen&quot;&gt;Other stuff I didn‚Äôt remember or even thought it would be possible to happen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wireless-debugging-and-multiple-simulators&quot;&gt;Wireless debugging and multiple simulators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was a surprise to me, specially because it makes so much sense and still, it was out of my radar for quite some time now. Remote debugging will only work with devices on iOS 11 but you can take advantage of multiple simulators right from Xcode beta 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improved-app-switcher-and-control-center&quot;&gt;Improved app switcher and Control Center&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to install iOS 11 on a device, but the first impression I got when watching the session where it was introduced was that‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt like it üòî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, having the ability to select which items to show on Control Center, together with app switcher on the iPad seems like an overflow of information. I guess Erica Sadun phrased it better than me on this blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/23/holy-war-why-i-utterly-loathe-the-new-app-switcher-in-ios-11/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my colleagues like it, so I will wait until I have upgraded my device to give a proper opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs it, it was a great event, with lots of new and cool stuff, that I can‚Äôt wait to put my hands on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: is it just me, or the actual presentations were not up to the higher standards that we are used to in these events? They didn‚Äôt seem well prepared, lots of hesitations from the presenters‚Ä¶ by all means, this is not a critic - specially from me, as I‚Äôm a terrible public presenter! - just a small comment, as we know Apple always try to have flawless presentations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adriano Goncalves</name></author><summary type="html">A couple of weeks have gone by since the closing curtains on this years WWDC, and in my opinion, what a great event it was.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">WWDC 2017 - what to expect</title><link href="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/06/02/what-to-expect-wwdc-2017/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="WWDC 2017 - what to expect" /><published>2017-06-02T22:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-06-02T22:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/06/02/what-to-expect-wwdc-2017</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/06/02/what-to-expect-wwdc-2017/">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs almost that time of the year where the Apple developers community has its biggest event - the WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year as usual, the expectation is around what new features the latest version of iOS will bring us, and maybe some hints to what is the future in terms of devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not very good at guessing, and to be honest, I have been falling back in terms of many of the latest SDKs delivered by Apple. I did some experiments around the Watch and AppleTV, played a bit with the Today widget, but unfortunately never delve deep inside those libraries. And regarding Messages, Siri, Car, Home, etc - I didn‚Äôt write a single line of code for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I‚Äôm not in a good position to play the guessing game, I can however do a short list of some of the expectations from the community and maybe share my opinion on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;around-the-web&quot;&gt;Around the Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;siri-speaker&quot;&gt;Siri Speaker&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Amazon and then Google started selling their devices, I guess it would make sense for Apple to jump into this train. According to some &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-vs-google-home-sales-estimates-chart-2017-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, in the US alone there are around 35M users of voice-enabled speakers in 2017, which represents an increase of 129%. This shows that is market relatively small, but with growing interest from the public. And by having already the software and most of the hardware needed, it wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult for Apple to come up with a device as good or even better than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;new-layout-of-the-iphones-back-side&quot;&gt;New layout of the iPhones back side&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many leaked pictures of the new iPhones show the cameras in a vertical orientation and a Touch ID sensor underneath the Apple logo. About the cameras I have no idea why they would need to change and honestly, it would look a bit weird to see them in that orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sensor, I would hate it! In my job as a developer, most of the times the phone is on top of the table and to start testing some new feature I‚Äôm working on, I don‚Äôt even grab the phone - I unlock it with a simple tap on the sensor and that‚Äôs it. And I don‚Äôt think Apple would do that change as it severely changes how people are used to interact and unlock the phone. Of course that doesn‚Äôt mean anything - previously you needed to swipe to unlock and now it‚Äôs just tap the sensor and then press the home button. The only way I would agree with this change, was if somehow you could do Touch ID anywhere on the front screen, that would be awesome! And if so, sure, add the sensor to the back also üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;new-ipad-pro-105-inch&quot;&gt;New iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only ever used an iPad Pro for a minute, so I have no opinion on this one. Probably it makes sense to have all the power and functionalities on a more portable form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;dark-mode&quot;&gt;Dark mode&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this one is new to me. It probably is a natural next step from previous features, like Night Shift. And if it‚Äôs true that future devices will have an OLED screen, as dark modes are more friendly on the batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-would-like-to-see&quot;&gt;What I would like to see&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;swift-refactoring-tools-on-xcode&quot;&gt;Swift refactoring tools on Xcode&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since Swift was released, this is one of the major flaws that Apple has yet to address. I know Xcode has now much better support for Swift: in the beginning typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@@&lt;/code&gt; would make it crash every time. And for me, coming from Portugal to an Irish keyboard layout (in PT layout, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are typed the same way as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; in the IRL layout), it was sooooo easy to make it crash! And if the Live View Hierarchy inspector or the recent Memory Graph tool shows that Apple cares about Xcode, not having the simplest of the refactoring tools makes some of the common developer tasks a bit more tedious and difficult than they could or should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;real-multitasking-on-ipad&quot;&gt;Real multitasking on iPad&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the year where we will see new developments in the iPad arena, I guess having true multitasking would make a lot of sense. Recently I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyFUDQ5LLZw&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; by Federico Viticci for Macstories of how that could look like and I believe implementing it in a similar way would bring the platform to a whole different level. Of course, with a bit of imagination and a lot of careful planning and hard work, you can kind of make it work right now, just look at the awesome work by the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.readdle.com/drag-drop-between-readdle-apps-fd079c756b23&quot;&gt;Readdle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adriano Goncalves</name></author><summary type="html">It‚Äôs almost that time of the year where the Apple developers community has its biggest event - the WWDC.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maybe not</title><link href="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/05/23/maybe-not/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maybe not" /><published>2017-05-23T22:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-05-23T22:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/05/23/maybe-not</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/05/23/maybe-not/">&lt;p&gt;Well, after all, maybe I wasn‚Äôt &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/13/first-post/&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; involved yet‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adriano Goncalves</name></author><summary type="html">Well, after all, maybe I wasn‚Äôt that involved yet‚Ä¶</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First post</title><link href="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/02/13/first-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First post" /><published>2017-02-13T22:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-13T22:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/02/13/first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amg1976.github.io/blog/2017/02/13/first-post/">&lt;p&gt;This is my first 100th post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am, however, really focused in getting this moving forward. First, because the platform where I‚Äôm hosting this website reminds me of my web developer days. Not that I don‚Äôt like working as a mobile developer, but it is nice having a break in Xcode, Swift, Certificates and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I feel the need to express myself, more than that, sometime in the future, I would like to work for my own and so maybe, by writing it here for everyone to see, it helps by putting some &lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt; on myself - after all, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll do this and then completely ignore it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adriano Goncalves</name></author><summary type="html">This is my first 100th post.</summary></entry></feed>
