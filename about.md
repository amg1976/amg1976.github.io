My name is Adriano, I'm from Portugal, and I have been living in Dublin since late 2014. I'm husband to a beautiful wife and proud father of two girls. Football fan (#slb) and snowboard enthusiast.

I have been developing for iOS since 2010, when I had the fortune of being invited by a friend to work on his startup.
