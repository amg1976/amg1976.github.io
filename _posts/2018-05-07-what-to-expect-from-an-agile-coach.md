title: What to expect from an Agile Coach?

This question was asked by my team manager. I believe the team has some knowledge of the Agile methodologies, but maybe not enough to use them in an effective manner. I guess the first evidence is that we bounce between Scrum and Kanban, and probably neither of them are being done correctly.

Another issue, which probably is more evident to the managers as they need to report progress and estimation to the higher ranks, is that we don't know what is our velocity, we don't have an idea how much we can deliver in each Sprint. We have done estimation in the past but then we just stopped doing it because we weren't actually tracking how accurate they were and how trustworthy they could be to perform any kind of estimation for future work. We started recently to do estimation again, so let's see how it goes.

Also, the backlog becomes very quickly out of control, especially with bugs (sometimes duplicates) and tech debt stories - at some point, our new product manager just decided to archive them all and start fresh!

So, answering the question, I would expect a Coach that has enough knowledge about the different approaches to Agile software development (which probably any coach does) but most of all, I would like to have someone with the capacity to understand the team dynamics, how we want to balance feature / tech debt / R&D work, and can provide us with a basic framework of how to achieve that balance, along with some guidelines on what different directions we can follow to adapt it to an ever-evolving team.
