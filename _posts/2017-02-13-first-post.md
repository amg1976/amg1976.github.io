This is my first 100th post.

I am, however, really focused in getting this moving forward. First, because the platform where I'm hosting this website reminds me of my web developer days. Not that I don't like working as a mobile developer, but it is nice having a break in Xcode, Swift, Certificates and everything else.

Also I feel the need to express myself, more than that, sometime in the future, I would like to work for my own and so maybe, by writing it here for everyone to see, it helps by putting some _pressure_ on myself - after all, I can't say I'll do this and then completely ignore it!
